# Bank-Line-Simulation
Bank line simulation, utilizing a link-based priority queue, and a circular based queue. 

The program inserts, and sorts customers into a theoretical bank line. Each customer is given a priority based on time waiting in the line. 

Both the circular and priority queue functions are template functions, and will allow all types of data types to be inserted.
